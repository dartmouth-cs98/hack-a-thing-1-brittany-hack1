	Description: I attempted to build a few different react-native apps from online tutorials. I did a simple app just to get my development environment set up, and then a weather app to explore more functionality.

	Who did what: Worked by myself!

	What you learned: Spent a lot of time reading about the differences between React and React-Native. The biggest hurdle was getting my environment set up as I had to do some weird things with node versions to get Expo to run correctly. A good learning experience as there's a high chance I will be using React-Native in my project, so it's good to get this out of the way!

	What didn't work: had some trouble getting the weather API working correctly, and couldn't complete a searchbar tutorial I wanted to do.
